State of Play,Reddit,,bobmlord1,"Overall the State of Play felt short and bland to me I actually spaced out somewhere in the middle. Astrobot stood out as looking, fun, colorful and frenetic with a lot of cute nostalgic bits.Â    The only games I'm certain are new were that Hero Shooter (which is a genre I actively despise), Astro Bot, and that dress-up RPG thing. There may have been some other new announcements in there but I legitimately am not sure anymore.Â    Nice to see a (n extremely short) look at the new Monster Hunter didn't expect them to go a story-heavy cinematic direction.   Â I feel like graphics are getting way too homogenized I had trouble telling a lot of games apart which I believe is related to studios using the same middleware engines and not actively customizing them. I don't know how a Fantasy Dress-up RPG and a Sci-fi Hero Shooter can look the same but they do.   Â Side-note I'm sad to see no Ape Escape in the background costumes/references in Astro Bot Sony really has forgotten about that franchise.

Might be okay though  Dynasty warriors is already a dlc weighed down menace that fails horribly at monetization and as a result will be a wait till its in the bargain bin game.. again  Monster hunter wilds was a shining diamond lying in a pile of cow shit  ASTRO will either be amazing or be bargain bin  Wind and the reeds, is going to be a game I buy anyway as a shameless lover of immortal Taoist mythos games, but nobody on Playstation community is gonna give a shit about this game, and it's going to get shit canned sight unseen as overly complicated, because by its very nature traditional wuxia is overly complicated.

State of Play,Reddit,,JWillCHS,"Live service games aren't going anywhere. They will continue to evolve with the evolution of the internet. They've been around way before Neverwinter on AOL which was a paid live service. Same thing with the early days of MMORPGs like Ultima Online, Asheron's Call, and Everquest. And all that was before World of Warcraft in 2004.  Even Xbox Live to an extent was prelude to it all on the original Xbox. Back then PC gamers were like, ""who is paying to use their internet to play simple multiplayer games like Call of Duty"". What's funny is you still do that with Playstation Plus and Xbox Game Pass today!  The business model just needs to change or they need to make great live service games. And as cost increases to make AAA games you'll continue to see more of it. The larger the industry gets the more it becomes a business and the less risks they want to take. The best advice you can give to these people is AT LEAST stick to what you do best even if you have to add microtransactions. I have a feeling if the cost of making videogames continues to grow, Sony will reduce the window for when a first-party title appears on PC and I wouldn't be surprise to see future simultaneous releases. It's either that or more live service games which they announce this week that they want a bigger push for that kind of stuff to release on both PC and PS5 day 1.",1,1,0,Rest of The World,,,05/31/2024,8 PM,Negative,Fear,Xbox

This one cute anime game, I kinda missed what it even was about?    The two VR Games looked interesting for everyone who has VR. So tbf thats probably some banger titles for them.

State of Play,Reddit,,Only-Ad4322,"So I think I can explain something about this State of Play. Concord is obviously Sonys new big game their pushing, it probably started development during the Overwatch craze and later the Battle Royale craze and, after some refinement, got to where it is today. I understand the frustration people have with yet another live service game but keep in mind, game development is long and the gaming audiences rejection of live service is fairly recent so Sony has already sunk time and money into this project and cant/wont just cancel it. As for the Soulslike, theres been an uptick in them since Elden Ring became â€œthe thing to talk aboutâ€? so to speak and won Game of the Year and again since game development started is long, a bunch of studios probably started working on their soulslike around the Elden Ring craze and so we are in a â€œharvest seasonâ€? for them. Id also imagine those lesser known studios think this might be their break out moment if they can make a good soulslike.

State of Play,Reddit,,trevordeal,Showing 2 Overwatch clones are the same time is so moronic. I don't understand who thought that was a good idea. Those games should be a year out from each other minimum.   Also... both will fail because Overwatch people aren't going to leave Overwatch just to play a different Overwatch. They aren't unique enough like something like Helldivers 2 which isn't a clone of anything.  Astro Bot will be a big success I feel and the Soulslike games will have some success and maybe one of them is really good and it gets some love from that Souls crowd but won't find the success of an Elden Ring.

Besides that, it's totally a Guardians of the Galaxy ripoff. At least the GotG game had a lengthy single player campaign.

Games are released for the least hardware capable devices being consoles for compatibility reasons. For this reason consoles are slowing down more capable PC hardware gaming.
