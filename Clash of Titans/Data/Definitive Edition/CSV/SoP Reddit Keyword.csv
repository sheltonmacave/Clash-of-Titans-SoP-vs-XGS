State of Play,Reddit,Abyss96,"I swear that the situation Sony is in with a lot of their fans is similar to the Opposite Day episode of SpongeBob where he keeps playing the clarinet for that lady and she insists shes heard enough, but he misunderstands and keeps playing.  Wheres that MediEvil II Remake? Legend of Dragoon sequel or prequel? Twisted Metal? Syphon Filter? Ape Escape? Parappa the Rapper and Um Jammer Lammy? Older fans have been asking for this stuff for forever now and Sony continues to give us the exact opposite of what were asking for  *edit for a thought I forgot to initially include - that Silent Hill 2 Remake trailer quite literally should have been part of the Silent Hill Transmission, the only reason it was part of State of Play was to save Sonys ass from a complete failure",1,0,Negative,Fear,Sony

State of Play,Reddit,aura_enchanted,"Concord is valorant for idiots  Marvelwatch  is overwatch for anyone who didn't see how much of a disaster batman vigilantes was. Or their hoping you forgot.  Silent hill 2 looked like a ps4 title  Ragnarok is coming to pc and requires a psn login, and is loaded with DRM, meaning it will sell like shit as Sony seeks to artificially pump its psn numbers up with pc users since the Playstation growth has stagnated while they desperatly try and stall for the ps5pro next year  Nikki  looks like its going to be a gacha  heavy genshin impact like game, except instead of characters it will be a gear treadmill. Might be okay though  Dynasty warriors is already a dlc weighed down menace that fails horribly at monetization and as a result will be a wait till its in the bargain bin game.. again  Monster hunter wilds was a shining diamond lying in a pile of cow shit  ASTRO will either be amazing or be bargain bin  Wind and the reeds, is going to be a game I buy anyway as a shameless lover of immortal Taoist mythos games, but nobody on Playstation community is gonna give a shit about this game, and it's going to get shit canned sight unseen as overly complicated, because by its very nature traditional wuxia is overly complicated.  And that last game looked like sonys answer to new God's..  which is funny cause if your trying to compete title for title with Xbox, new gods is definitely not a high priority target",0,0,Negative,Fear,Game
State of Play,Reddit,aura_enchanted,"Cause if Sony wants to live on in the gaming sphere once the consoles die, they will need a foot in the door on pc.  Fact is that we are rapidly approaching an industry singularity. And Microsoft is trying to desperately hold as many cards as humanly possible to try and save the Xbox ecosystem  Nintendo just needs to cultivate their 1st parties and market it correctly and the switch 2 will probably money print like a motherfucker for them  And pc gaming is immune to industry shocks cause as long as someone wants to rub two sticks together and code a video-game pc will get games.  Simply put, Sony is the weakest link and they know it, and if they want to have any hope of publishing games once the Playstation gets shot like ol' yeller, they will need inroads to the pc market",-2,1,Negative,Fear,Sony

State of Play,Reddit,bobmlord1,"Overall the State of Play felt short and bland to me I actually spaced out somewhere in the middle. Astrobot stood out as looking, fun, colorful and frenetic with a lot of cute nostalgic bits.Â    The only games I'm certain are new were that Hero Shooter (which is a genre I actively despise), Astro Bot, and that dress-up RPG thing. There may have been some other new announcements in there but I legitimately am not sure anymore.Â    Nice to see a (n extremely short) look at the new Monster Hunter didn't expect them to go a story-heavy cinematic direction.   Â I feel like graphics are getting way too homogenized I had trouble telling a lot of games apart which I believe is related to studios using the same middleware engines and not actively customizing them. I don't know how a Fantasy Dress-up RPG and a Sci-fi Hero Shooter can look the same but they do.   Â Side-note I'm sad to see no Ape Escape in the background costumes/references in Astro Bot Sony really has forgotten about that franchise. Edit: Actually there might be a spike hairdo in the ending shot",1,0,Negative,Sad,Astro Bot

State of Play,Reddit,JWillCHS,"Live service games aren't going anywhere. They will continue to evolve with the evolution of the internet. They've been around way before Neverwinter on AOL which was a paid live service. Same thing with the early days of MMORPGs like Ultima Online, Asheron's Call, and Everquest. And all that was before World of Warcraft in 2004.  Even Xbox Live to an extent was prelude to it all on the original Xbox. Back then PC gamers were like, ""who is paying to use their internet to play simple multiplayer games like Call of Duty"". What's funny is you still do that with Playstation Plus and Xbox Game Pass today!  The business model just needs to change or they need to make great live service games. And as cost increases to make AAA games you'll continue to see more of it. The larger the industry gets the more it becomes a business and the less risks they want to take. The best advice you can give to these people is AT LEAST stick to what you do best even if you have to add microtransactions. I have a feeling if the cost of making videogames continues to grow, Sony will reduce the window for when a first-party title appears on PC and I wouldn't be surprise to see future simultaneous releases. It's either that or more live service games which they announce this week that they want a bigger push for that kind of stuff to release on both PC and PS5 day 1.",1,1,Negative,Fear,Xbox

This one cute anime game, I kinda missed what it even was about?    The two VR Games looked interesting for everyone who has VR. So tbf thats probably some banger titles for them.

Concord is obviously Sonys new big game their pushing, it probably started development during the Overwatch craze and later the Battle Royale craze and, after some refinement, got to where it is today. I understand the frustration people have with yet another live service game but keep in mind, game development is long and the gaming audiences rejection of live service is fairly recent so Sony has already sunk time and money into this project and cant/wont just cancel it. As for the Soulslike, theres been an uptick in them since Elden Ring became â€œthe thing to talk aboutâ€? so to speak and won Game of the Year and again since game development started is long, a bunch of studios probably started working on their soulslike around the Elden Ring craze and so we are in a â€œharvest seasonâ€? for them.
