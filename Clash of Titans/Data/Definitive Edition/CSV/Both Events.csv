Last year it was the extended showcase (I assumed we'd get that again, but they haven't specified so I'm not sure the medium, hopefully not just xbox wire articles). But they go into tech and stuff there.   The big miss from E3 is the convention atmosphere and on-site presence. A live digital showcase case just isn't really ""live"". Even just playing the prepared showcase at a major onsite venue is just different. Nothing I've seen of Xbox Fanfest or Summer Game Fest really replicates this. I never got to go to E3 myself, but I have started going to major conventions like MCM London and even stuff like the Sonic Symphony and the vibe just hits so different. In comparison the ""not-E3s"" all feel just too ""controlled"".   I think Microsoft is probably in the best position now with all the first party content they own to put on a major comic con level convention in the summer around the showcase to bring gamers together. And I really think they should. It'd do so much for the Xbox brand (which gets so much hate or is just ignored or unknown because Microsoft doesn't market it) and make it a center of gaming. These past few showcases have shown a major dedication in working with partners for huge third party reveals. They should bank on that. They don't want to make every third party game exclusive like Sony. That's fine but they still need to do something to tell people to buy an Xbox to play those games.

They will be able to to that with Black Ops 6 as theyre already doing with Diablo IV, but putting Black Ops 1, 2, 3 or any older title theres little to none they could further monetize on those games, plus the real problem is that older games can eat into the audience of the current games which are way more profitable, now you get the issue?

Uncharted has much better stories, much tighter gameplay, and much better set pieces to where you feel youre in an action movie. The first uncharted is a bit worse than the rest of them but still solid. A big difference is that tomb raider is semi-open world, with random objects and collectibles dotted around, I think there was crafting too. Uncharted is linear, no crafting at all, and is overall a very polished and concise experience (you can beat them all in like 10-12 hours each first time through).  What I love about uncharted is they really know what theyre trying to do and stick to it. Even on ps3 the graphics were great for what they were, stories are awesome, puzzles are fun, and Nathan drake throws around great one liners. I would definitely recommend everyone play through the uncharted series at least once.  So I did enjoy both series, but overall I just like the well curated gameplay of uncharted. Ultimately youre still doing the same stuff though, traveling to exotic locations, looking for treasure, solving puzzles, shooting bad guys, and climbing around ruins.

Astrobot stood out as looking, fun, colorful and frenetic with a lot of cute nostalgic bits.Â    The only games I'm certain are new were that Hero Shooter (which is a genre I actively despise), Astro Bot, and that dress-up RPG thing. There may have been some other new announcements in there but I legitimately am not sure anymore.Â    Nice to see a (n extremely short) look at the new Monster Hunter didn't expect them to go a story-heavy cinematic direction.   Â I feel like graphics are getting way too homogenized I had trouble telling a lot of games apart which I believe is related to studios using the same middleware engines and not actively customizing them. I don't know how a Fantasy Dress-up RPG and a Sci-fi Hero Shooter can look the same but they do.   Â Side-note I'm sad to see no Ape Escape in the background costumes/references in Astro Bot Sony really has forgotten about that franchise.

They've been around way before Neverwinter on AOL which was a paid live service. Same thing with the early days of MMORPGs like Ultima Online, Asheron's Call, and Everquest. And all that was before World of Warcraft in 2004.  Even Xbox Live to an extent was prelude to it all on the original Xbox. Back then PC gamers were like, ""who is paying to use their internet to play simple multiplayer games like Call of Duty"". What's funny is you still do that with Playstation Plus and Xbox Game Pass today!  The business model just needs to change or they need to make great live service games. And as cost increases to make AAA games you'll continue to see more of it. The larger the industry gets the more it becomes a business and the less risks they want to take. The best advice you can give to these people is AT LEAST stick to what you do best even if you have to add microtransactions. I have a feeling if the cost of making videogames continues to grow, Sony will reduce the window for when a first-party title appears on PC and I wouldn't be surprise to see future simultaneous releases.

Xbox Games Showcase,Reddit,,ReservoirDog316,"Well thats my point. Sony is *so* radically out in first place ahead of Xbox that theyre complacent. Xbox is on the ropes so they finally come out swinging.   Now to be clear, I think its a bit more complicated than just that since I think Covid delays from years ago did leave a gap in their release schedule, on top of TLoU live service game being canceled when it was presumably gonna be Sonys big release of l fall 2024. But in a broader picture, Sony seems to have lost its way a bit by focusing away from their strengths and instead on live service stuff that isnt panning out. I will say I *really* appreciate that theyd just allow ND to cancel that TLoU live service game instead of releasing it and sullying their spotless record (seriously, imagine Jak 3 being the worst? game they ever released, insane stuff). People were critical of that but think how much respect they have for ND to just cancel a game that was presumably really far along in development. Live service games have launched with meager amounts of content at full price so they couldve done it but didnt.   But still, Sony needs to have a feel some competition to get back on the ball. I do believe if they revealed the stuff they currently have cooking from Sucker Punch and Insomniac and ND and all their other devs, it would be a little more even, but that stuff is probably late 2025 at best, so whatever. I personally like when they reveal stuff thats a long ways off but I know Im in the minority there.",1,1,0,Rest of The World,,,06/06/2024,10 AM,Negative,Sad,

Xbox Games Showcase,Reddit,,Unknown_User261,"Unfortunately this isn't anything new. Xbox has an awful habit of dumping everything in the fall season. They could literally do their ""one AAA first party game a quarter"" if they figured out this. Last year was the most releases Xbox has done in the first half in a while (Hi-Fi, AOE console, Legends, Redfall) and only two were really good. Summer was dry as usual and then all their heavy hitters came out back to back in fall. Its actually starting to look like a problem if they stick to these release dates with how much Xbox first party games are going to compete with themselves all day one on Game Pass. Yeah, people won't have to buy one or the other but they still only have limited time. That's not even counting all the third party fall releases.

The game is also MUCH less forgiving in terms of detection so if you don't have a perfect stealth build, sniping is going to attract attention and get literally dozens of soldiers on you. The level design makes it very hard to avoid gunfights. I can't remember EVER using my SMG in the first game. I used it constantly in 5, and that was while save scumming constantly to avoid alarms.  It's not a bad game, but all of the new mechanics and level design detract from the major reason anyone plays the series, which is shooting nazis in the dick and watching the bullet obliterate each organ on the way in and out.

Might be okay though  Dynasty warriors is already a dlc weighed down menace that fails horribly at monetization and as a result will be a wait till its in the bargain bin game.. again  Monster hunter wilds was a shining diamond lying in a pile of cow shit  ASTRO will either be amazing or be bargain bin  Wind and the reeds, is going to be a game I buy anyway as a shameless lover of immortal Taoist mythos games, but nobody on Playstation community is gonna give a shit about this game, and it's going to get shit canned sight unseen as overly complicated, because by its very nature traditional wuxia is overly complicated.

The cutscene and the lore behind it made such a good impression until I saw the gameplay. I mean the game doesnt look bad at all but do we really need another PVP Hero shooter? Idk chief.   Then until dawn. The whole time I thought they were about to drop until dawn 2 but its just a remake of the old game??   You can already play the old game on the ps5 normally and its not that old that the graphics are a problem.    ~~And I was quite sure that a PC Version already exists of the game?~~ . Ok apparently there wasnt a pc version of the game. Furthermore who the fuck asked about until dawn in the last couple of years? I mean its not a bad game but just buy the original for cheap money?  This one cute anime game, I kinda missed what it even was about?    The two VR Games looked interesting for everyone who has VR. So tbf thats probably some banger titles for them.   Annnnnd last but not least the souls like games... I mean they looked good, so probably some good stuff for souls like fans. I sadly do not have the patience for such games, I really need an easy mode for souls like games.

State of Play,Reddit,,Only-Ad4322,"So I think I can explain something about this State of Play. Concord is obviously Sonys new big game their pushing, it probably started development during the Overwatch craze and later the Battle Royale craze and, after some refinement, got to where it is today. I understand the frustration people have with yet another live service game but keep in mind, game development is long and the gaming audiences rejection of live service is fairly recent so Sony has already sunk time and money into this project and cant/wont just cancel it. As for the Soulslike, theres been an uptick in them since Elden Ring became â€œthe thing to talk aboutâ€? so to speak and won Game of the Year and again since game development started is long, a bunch of studios probably started working on their soulslike around the Elden Ring craze and so we are in a â€œharvest seasonâ€? for them. Id also imagine those lesser known studios think this might be their break out moment if they can make a good soulslike.

There are only a pathetic one or three NPC's using asset instances rendered to be animated on screen at one time hence the CPU and GPU compute power is seriously lacking. Games are released for the least hardware capable devices being consoles for compatibility reasons. For this reason consoles are slowing down more capable PC hardware gaming.
