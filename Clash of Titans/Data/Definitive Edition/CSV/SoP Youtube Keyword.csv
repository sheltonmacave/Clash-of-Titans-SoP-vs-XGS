There are only a pathetic one or three NPC's using asset instances rendered to be animated on screen at one time hence the CPU and GPU compute power is seriously lacking. Games are released for the least hardware capable devices being consoles for compatibility reasons. For this reason consoles are slowing down more capable PC hardware gaming.
