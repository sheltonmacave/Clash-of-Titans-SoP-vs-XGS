Big_Liability,62,can someone actually explain to me why PC ports of games are so hyped? Wasnt this a PLAYSTATION showcase? PC ports can be tweeted about. They dont need a whole ass trailer for them,13

ndp1983,7,"God PlayStation has really gone down hill the last few years. Rehashed games, copies of other games ( cue concord), no original ideas coming from a company that used to harness innovation. Just a bunch of number crunching suits trying to play it safe and not take any chances.",1

GioWerneck,2,"I just wanted a tease for the new AAA games from the major studios, like Santa Monica did with GOWR back in 2020: just a chilling familiar soundtrack and the logo, that‚Äôs all. Doesn‚Äôt even need to show release date or more info, just like ‚Äúwe are doing it‚Äù.",0
IcyChard4,2,"As I said before, this state of play doesn't offer anything major from what we want (like their exclusives). Astro Bot to me is the only major title they featured.

trevordeal,1,Showing 2 Overwatch clones are the same time is so moronic. I don't understand who thought that was a good idea. Those games should be a year out from each other minimum.   Also... both will fail because Overwatch people aren't going to leave Overwatch just to play a different Overwatch. They aren't unique enough like something like Helldivers 2 which isn't a clone of anything.  Astro Bot will be a big success I feel and the Soulslike games will have some success and maybe one of them is really good and it gets some love from that Souls crowd but won't find the success of an Elden Ring.   Pretty low-key State of Play with too much of the same thing.,0

The_Good_Mortt,1,"I think this was overall pretty wack. I loved the Monster Hunter gameplay reveal, Astrobot, and that's about it. Nothing else really moved the needle for me.   Also really frustrates me that Naughty Dog wasted all that time from 2020 - 2024 making that damn TLOU Live Service joint. I wonder how much that impacted development on their core stuff.   No Sucker Punch, no Bluepoint, no Naughty Dog, no Santa Monica (I know they just released a game and a DLC so I didn't really expect them), no new Helldivers 2 stuff, just nothing that anyone really cares about. Concord looks like 100 other games I've seen in the last 10 years.   I hope they can right this ship, and I believe in Herman Hulst. I just hope it happens sooner rather than later, because right now I'm more excited about my Nintendo Switch (an 8 year old last Gen console) than my PS5.",0

Abyss96,1,"I swear that the situation Sony is in with a lot of their fans is similar to the Opposite Day episode of SpongeBob where he keeps playing the clarinet for that lady and she insists she‚Äôs heard enough, but he misunderstands and keeps playing.

Older fans have been asking for this stuff for forever now and Sony continues to give us the exact opposite of what we‚Äôre asking for  *edit for a thought I forgot to initially include - that Silent Hill 2 Remake trailer quite literally should have been part of the Silent Hill Transmission, the only reason it was part of State of Play was to save Sony‚Äôs ass from a complete failure",0

MostlyApe,1,"100% Trash. Playstation 5 is the first Sony console I've ever regretted buying. Absolute waste of a console generation. Thanks for a $580 glorified billboard machine, $80 cover fee for multiplayer and barely any games that utilize the hardware. I guess it's more fun to buy and close studios emblazoned in an industry wide war of attrition, than it is to make fun and quality games. No ones excited for more over-monetized hero shooters and live service garbage. We're disgusted. Industry suits are so out of touch with the players it's ridiculous. Absolute snooze-fest. Wake me when you return to franchises that once excited the player base...like Twisted Metal, Socom, Resistance, Bloodborne or even WipeOut. Modern gaming is so bland. Zzzzz",1
Jedden,-1,That was garbage. Not one interesting thing showed,0
bobmlord1,1,"Overall the State of Play felt short and bland to me I actually spaced out somewhere in the middle. Astrobot stood out as looking, fun, colorful and frenetic with a lot of cute nostalgic bits.¬†   The only games I'm certain are new were that Hero Shooter (which is a genre I actively despise), Astro Bot, and that dress-up RPG thing. There may have been some other new announcements in there but I legitimately am not sure anymore.¬†   Nice to see a (n extremely short) look at the new Monster Hunter didn't expect them to go a story-heavy cinematic direction.   ¬†I feel like graphics are getting way too homogenized I had trouble telling a lot of games apart which I believe is related to studios using the same middleware engines and not actively customizing them. I don't know how a Fantasy Dress-up RPG and a Sci-fi Hero Shooter can look the same but they do.   ¬†Side-note I'm sad to see no Ape Escape in the background costumes/references in Astro Bot Sony really has forgotten about that franchise. Edit: Actually there might be a spike hairdo in the ending shot",0

Killerbeth,0,"ahahah tbh this State of Play was kinda fun  I feel so bad about the developers of Concord because everyone agrees that no one asked for a game like this lmao.    The cutscene and the lore behind it made such a good impression until I saw the gameplay. I mean the game doesnt look bad at all but do we really need another PVP Hero shooter? Idk chief.   Then until dawn. The whole time I thought they were about to drop until dawn 2 but its just a remake of the old game??   You can already play the old game on the ps5 normally and its not that old that the graphics are a problem.    ~~And I was quite sure that a PC Version already exists of the game?~~ . Ok apparently there wasnt a pc version of the game. Furthermore who the fuck asked about until dawn in the last couple of years? I mean its not a bad game but just buy the original for cheap money?  This one cute anime game, I kinda missed what it even was about?    The two VR Games looked interesting for everyone who has VR. So tbf thats probably some banger titles for them.   Annnnnd last but not least the souls like games... I mean they looked good, so probably some good stuff for souls like fans. I sadly do not have the patience for such games, I really need an easy mode for souls like games.  Oh yea and if the new astro bot comes out as free to play thats definietly gonna be a 10/10 banger",0

aura_enchanted,0,"Concord is valorant for idiots  Marvelwatch  is overwatch for anyone who didn't see how much of a disaster batman vigilantes was. Or their hoping you forgot.  Silent hill 2 looked like a ps4 title  Ragnarok is coming to pc and requires a psn login, and is loaded with DRM, meaning it will sell like shit as Sony seeks to artificially pump its psn numbers up with pc users since the Playstation growth has stagnated while they desperatly try and stall for the ps5pro next year  Nikki  looks like its going to be a gacha  heavy genshin impact like game, except instead of characters it will be a gear treadmill. Might be okay though  Dynasty warriors is already a dlc weighed down menace that fails horribly at monetization and as a result will be a wait till its in the bargain bin game.. again  Monster hunter wilds was a shining diamond lying in a pile of cow shit  ASTRO will either be amazing or be bargain bin  Wind and the reeds, is going to be a game I buy anyway as a shameless lover of immortal Taoist mythos games, but nobody on Playstation community is gonna give a shit about this game, and it's going to get shit canned sight unseen as overly complicated, because by its very nature traditional wuxia is overly complicated.  And that last game looked like sonys answer to new God's..  which is funny cause if your trying to compete title for title with Xbox, new gods is definitely not a high priority target",0
veryblessed123,0,"Such an embarrassing and underwhelming State of Play.  You like Live Service Games? You like Souls Likes? You like janky PC releases of Sony games? You like gritty medieval fantasy games?  Well, have we got the games for you!  Concord looks awful. Such cringe Marvel humor.",0
Only-Ad4322,0,"So I think I can explain something about this State of Play. Concord is obviously Sony‚Äôs new big game their pushing, it probably started development during the Overwatch craze and later the Battle Royale craze and, after some refinement, got to where it is today. I understand the frustration people have with yet another live service game but keep in mind, game development is long and the gaming audience‚Äôs rejection of live service is fairly recent so Sony has already sunk time and money into this project and can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt just cancel it. As for the Soulslike, there‚Äôs been an uptick in them since Elden Ring became ‚Äúthe thing to talk about‚Äù so to speak and won Game of the Year and again since game development started is long, a bunch of studios probably started working on their soulslike around the Elden Ring craze and so we are in a ‚Äúharvest season‚Äù for them. I‚Äôd also imagine those lesser known studios think this might be their break out moment if they can make a good soulslike. That‚Äôs my interpretation at least.",0

m3junmags,37,Shit was soooooo underwhelming,1
GolfIsGood66,6,Why did Silent Hill look so poor though? Isn't it a remake?,4
kudoshinichi-8211,0,I can‚Äôt help but it looks like Leon from RE4 in Silent Hill 2 remake with third person camera. It looks like generic zombie/horror shooter,0

Alt_SWR,1,No really that's what I'm fucking saying. They have limited time for these events and they waste half of it on a multiplayer game no one gives a fuck about and remakes/PC releases. Where's the Sony from the mid 2010s to early 2020s?!,1
Proof-Research-6466,2,Literally told my wife they could‚Äôve tweeted that shit lmao,0
Mast3rBait3rPro,1,I kind of agree but a lot of pc only players appreciate it. I also have a gaming pc so I understand it,0
kudoshinichi-8211,1,Why they are calling as PC port when literally they work only on Windows PC and not directly on Linux or steam deck without a translation layer running a game on a platform using a translation layer is not a port,0
SometimesWill,1,Why not be hype that there‚Äôs more people you can share enjoyment of something with?,0
Limekilnlake,1,"Could be because it‚Äôs that playstation (the business unit) is showing what it‚Äôs making, rather than playstation (the console)",0
None,1,Pc has the biggest audience so why not. Also they probably needed to fill some time in the presentation as they had very little to show as usual,0
aura_enchanted,-2,"Cause if Sony wants to live on in the gaming sphere once the consoles die, they will need a foot in the door on pc.  Fact is that we are rapidly approaching an industry singularity. And Microsoft is trying to desperately hold as many cards as humanly possible to try and save the Xbox ecosystem  Nintendo just needs to cultivate their 1st parties and market it correctly and the switch 2 will probably money print like a motherfucker for them  And pc gaming is immune to industry shocks cause as long as someone wants to rub two sticks together and code a video-game pc will get games.  Simply put, Sony is the weakest link and they know it, and if they want to have any hope of publishing games once the Playstation gets shot like ol' yeller, they will need inroads to the pc market",1

WispyDan14,20,A playable guardians of the galaxy game where you and a team of colorful characters pull of missions and heists in space could've genuinely be good if it wasn't a boring-ass PvP overwatch clone. If it HAD to be multiplayer live service then it should've at least been PvE,0

Wolfy-615,1,I prefer 3D like this over sidescrollers but yes.. looks fun af.. one of my 4 ever Platinumed games  Edit: I think they teased the PS5 Pro in the Astro trailer.. it was black with blue lighting ü§î,0
Wolfy-615,1,The fps and graphics are PS3-esque tho.. we‚Äôre in modern gen and they keep dropping these choppy games out,1
IndividualAd3140,1,Your damn right. Monster Hunter dont miss.¬†,0
TheInconspicuousBIG,1,Lmao there have been much worse than today‚Äôs showcase.,1
throwawayppddss,18,"state of plays always suck, they are never any good. Even last years ‚Äúbig‚Äù showcase was absolutely terrible, sony has been lacking",2
GolfIsGood66,3,"I didn't know that, that's infuriating.",1
GolfIsGood66,0,"I dunno man, it looked like ass to me tbh. I'll still buy it though, loved the original.",1
GolfIsGood66,2,Yeah it was weird,0
Master_Caregiver_749,2,"That's fine, really. Not every year needs to top the previous one. Also, it helps with backlog!",2
rhaesdaenys,3,I'm not a console gamer. I appreciate the PC trailers.,1
Square_Barracuda_327,2,"üíØ   focus has definitely switched to profit since corpos are making decisions instead of creatives like it was in the early days when it was ""games by gamers for gamers"", like Sven from Larian referenced recently.. at least for AAA titles.  quality and creativity suffers.. the market is flooded by cash grabs, but there is a niche of good games being made for the right reasons. Just takes a little more searching these days and will power to not buy the $500 skins they're putting out lol",0
Mother-Lavishness-77,-4,Until dawn is just the game no other is better except HoA  and marvel rivals looks so good,0
DiabeticGirthGod,-2,My balls + your forehead,0
zekerthedog,-2,we should have been able to decipher which leaks were real before the state of play?,1
yo_boy_dg,0,![gif](giphy|n4oKYFlAcv2AU)  I don‚Äôt understand why anyone was expecting so much when they told people this at the start of the year right? This state of play wasn‚Äôt THAT bad though.,0
PushThePig28,0,I mean you aren‚Äôt wrong about the lack of exclusives until recently. Feels like games that made the purchase worth it really just started releasing more consistently. I just got a ps5 when Spiderman 2 came out so it feels new for me still.,0
Captain_Thor27,2,"I'm aware, but they show the big name first party games in Showcases. Unfortunately, we'll probably have to wait till September.",0
SadKazoo,37,It‚Äôs just a weird fusion. I think their world building and lore has potential. I just can‚Äôt be assed to play a competitive hero shooter to see it.,2
Acidz_123,1,"Ironically, this was the one part of the trailer that intrigued me lol. The gameplay was meh, but I'm a lore/world building nerd and seeing that they put effort into expanding the lore like that got my attention. If the game's free (I doubt it will be) I'll definitely pick it up because of that. But I know that it's essentially DOA because gameplay is the most important and that part is definitely lacking.",0
Pliskin14,0,"Speak for yourself, I do. The Overwatch shorts are some of the best content there is.",0
Hesj,0,"Eh, not necessarily true. People don't play the games because of the story, but the story can be really interesting.  Easiest example is Overwatch, which I used to play quite a lot a couple years ago. The lore and story ""content"" (most of it wasn't in game but instead in comics and trailers) was quite intriguing.",0
emibost,1,"Silent hill 2, 5v5 shooter online only",0
Packin-heat,2,I think people should have realised by now there's always room for one more. Sure loads of them fail but it has been proven time and time again there's always room for another one.,0
topkingdededemain,1,Gross,0
Mean_Peen,3,"I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised they‚Äôre going to measure the popularity of these titles to weigh whether or not they should expand or remake them. Let‚Äôs face it, creativity is sorely lacking nowadays, so the idea of remaking ‚Äúclassics‚Äù just makes more sense. This is the perfect research platform to determine where to allocate resources, imo. We may see a few classics come back to the fold, though I‚Äôm still not going to hold my breath",0
Kaneki_The_TSM_Kami,26,I wish it finished sooner.. everything but Astro Bot was a waste of time,1
Will33iam,3,But it will probably be full of micro transactions which is no bueno for me,1
D1amondDude,2,"If they just had someone stand up and say ""It's an overwatch clone, but aesthetically it's bootleg Guardians of the Galaxy"", we would have gotten the entire picture in less than a minute.",0
mekisoku,3,Judging from the content and the quality of the previous game I would gladly pay 60,0
NormanCheetus,1,"It was an off-hand opinion. I specifically said what ""I PERSONALLY"" am willing to play. Astro's Playroom is the highest quality game on Playstation 5, so I was giving it personal praise by saying that I PERSONALLY am willing to pay a premium for it, because the game devs actually deserve the money.  >I'm a broke dipshit you're wrong I'm right my parents won't let me spend $70 from their credit card and I missed your point.  https://gbatemp.net/threads/game-prices-in-the-90s.588230/  Game prices have not risen with inflation for about 40 years. They depreciated down from $70 - $90 price tags.  Price inflation in games happened with AAA publishers putting microtransactions, battlepass and gacha mechanics in their games. So it's ironic that you've no problem being a Wuthering Waves addict.",0
anonymousss11,-1,"The proper syntax for knowing it won't be free would be ""it would have been great...""",0
PaleReputation1421,1,https://youtu.be/YPrtOO7veBE?si=0f4VTGeREspbC_BM  I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks this..,1
ellayzee,-1,Not at all. I was adding onto your comment. That‚Äôs how conversations work lol,1
IndividualAd3140,1,I feel you but what can we do brother? idiots just buy everything up no matter what.The wheel will keep spinning on the wallets of the dumb.¬†,1
IndividualAd3140,-3,And? It doesn't change the fact it's an L.,1
Big_Liability,5,If that's the state sony is in then it's BAD,1
ryushiblade,1,"Nintendo is the only one who almost always does well in these ‚Äî inversely, the MS and Sony ones are almost always underwhelming  I‚Äôm convinced part of it is Nintendo‚Äôs adherence to pacing and order, combined with a generally good balance between first party and indie games, and a good genre spread  I love my PS5, but dear lord does Sony need a better marketing/social media department",1
FunkinDonutzz,6,Yep. The second Bloober Team were announced as the developers my hype went from one hundred to zero almost instantly.,1
gkeiser23,2,"I‚Äôve never played the original so I don‚Äôt have much to compare it too. I loved the RE2 remake though, and it looks similar so I‚Äôm sold",0
Velocity_Rob,1,I mean you‚Äôre not wrong. I‚Äôve been playing Persona 5 for the last month.,0
BombproofAura,0,Nice cope mongoloid,1
Big_Liability,4,PC trailers for a game that already has trailers for it's console release doesnt even make sense to me. It's the same game,2
Distinct-Shift-4094,1,"Bro, which publication did you see GOT2 was going to be revealed in the State of Play? Reddit? IGN, Gamespot, Kotaku none of these said that. They did mention Astro Bot, God of War PC, Concord, etc.",1
Ok_Buffalo6474,14,"Same. What happens if I get busy and miss a couple months? I‚Äôd probably be less interested in the story when I came back to it, would I sit through all the cutscenes or would just want to play the game and skip it all making it kinda futile.Idk I guess that‚Äôs the new way to implement story features into these games.",0
shemmegami,-1,"That's not a bad thing. I'm interested in it.  Maybe there are a lot more like yourself who would watch a monthly YouTube compilation. You're still part of the community then, just not an active participant.   What were your thoughts on the rest though? It's the most excited I've been post State of Play. The lowest points for me were probably Dynasty or Infinity Nikki.",0
Numerous_Ticket_7628,7,Yep.,0
kadosho,1,Aye. It's a feature ü§¶ there are so many PvP titles out there as is.,1
JWillCHS,1,"Live service games aren't going anywhere. They will continue to evolve with the evolution of the internet. They've been around way before Neverwinter on AOL which was a paid live service. Same thing with the early days of MMORPGs like Ultima Online, Asheron's Call, and Everquest. And all that was before World of Warcraft in 2004.  Even Xbox Live to an extent was prelude to it all on the original Xbox. Back then PC gamers were like, ""who is paying to use their internet to play simple multiplayer games like Call of Duty"". What's funny is you still do that with Playstation Plus and Xbox Game Pass today!  The business model just needs to change or they need to make great live service games. And as cost increases to make AAA games you'll continue to see more of it. The larger the industry gets the more it becomes a business and the less risks they want to take. The best advice you can give to these people is AT LEAST stick to what you do best even if you have to add microtransactions. I have a feeling if the cost of making videogames continues to grow, Sony will reduce the window for when a first-party title appears on PC and I wouldn't be surprise to see future simultaneous releases. It's either that or more live service games which they announce this week that they want a bigger push for that kind of stuff to release on both PC and PS5 day 1. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)",1
Cold_Cartoonist_19,2,"Sorry man its like 2 am here, yeah multiplayer isnt going anywhere ever imo. Who doesnt like playing with their friends?",1
Wolfy-615,2,I agree that we are gamer brothers.. but THIS idiot will never buy a game that looks old gen ever again.. Dead Space ruined me on that.. clunky unupdated controls ü§¢,0
TheInconspicuousBIG,2,Damn you are one pissy guy,1
Sm00thSinceUnder00s,7,"The worst thing is, this generation is the most profitable for PlayStation so they think they‚Äôre doing good‚Ä¶",0
throwawayppddss,1,"microsoft‚Äôs are actually usually better than sonys now adays, but they never actually end up delivering on what they promise",0
J_Speedy306,3,How shit are they? The game looked quite well while true to the original to me. Should we expect a lot of bugs?,2
Master_Caregiver_749,1,"Ok...and what's so bad about it? As far as I'm concerned, fewer games that I'm excited about mean more games I get to play from my backlog.",1
FunkinDonutzz,1,It's to promote _checks notes_ the fact it's coming to PC.   It's really not supposed to be deep.,0
npretzel02,0,"When a game is ported to PC it includes a host of new features like keyboard and mouse, ray tracing possibly, DLSS. They want to show those off",1
zekerthedog,1,"Was a Twitter post by someone named haothors, you can search this sub and see all the speculation",1
Will33iam,1,And the problem is that the market is currently over saturated with pvp micro transaction games,1
PaleReputation1421,1,True. At least stick to what you know. I feel like every developer now days is trying their hand at a ‚ÄúLSG‚Äù. Lame.,0
ellayzee,0,It‚Äôs good lol. Yeah I‚Äôm agreeing with you. But mainly idk why people get so upset about stuff they can‚Äôt control. Most people like this thing and you do not. Sorry but it‚Äôs gonna be popular. Just ignore it lol.,0
IndividualAd3140,1,I don't see how. Your literally the one insulting and getting on the offensive. Besides one look at your comment history shows you have bad takes and are definitely the more pissy of the pissed people lmfao.,1
SoberEnAfrique,3,"They famously have like zero actual gameplay. They excel at walking simulators with great atmosphere and jump scares, but anything related to puzzles or combat will suck (probably)",0
null591,4,"Bloober Team are notorious for making derivative horror games such as Layers of Fear, you can find a ton of videos about this going in depth as to how much they copy, they also have zero subtlety when it comes to dark subject matter so handing them Silent Hill 2 is a disasterclass from Konami.",0
BombproofAura,1,"We can just crash the whole industry and just keeps playing New Vegas and games from 15 years ago where we actually made games and not C tier movies trying to copy final fantasy the spirits within.   Mass effect trilogy was all released in a spam of 6 years, have fun ""playing"" all those new videogames lmao",1
KinoCactus,1,They don't need a whole trailer in their presentation for that. Release a separate trailer having nothing to do with the presentation.   The Until Dawn rerelease was also a waste of time.,0
Distinct-Shift-4094,1,"So, let it be a lesson for you. Next time stop using Twitter for ""real leaks."" You'll get the real one from gaming outlets. IGN, Gamespot, Eurogamer, Kotaku all of them literally said exactly what was going to be shown in the showcase.",1
kadosho,1,Indeed. It is a chaotic mess out there,0
TheInconspicuousBIG,1,Nah man cmon you gotta read. Just said there have been many worse showcases over the years in a way that went over your head I think lol,1
Master_Caregiver_749,1,"Agree to disagree then. There are plenty of new games coming. Just because you are not interested in them doesn't mean they aren't there. Big gaming companies aren't the only ones making games, you know.",0
zekerthedog,1,Can you link me to those posts?,0
IndividualAd3140,0,It's not gone over my head at all. I know what your saying. I know this ain't the first time but saying there's worse is subjective. Depends on what you like or dislike. This one for me was deffo the biggest L.¬†,1
