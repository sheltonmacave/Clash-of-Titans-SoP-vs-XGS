I can't believe it's been like 6 years since we were first shown Perfect Dark, Fable and Avowed and they STILL don't have concrete release dates.   I also think they should've dropped the Series S.

Most of what was shown is what we've seen in previous years, not that much to be excited for but I think Fable is meant to be a standout game that's why it's taking so long. Compulsion Games has some good themes and could have an indie hit on their hands with South of Midnight.  I think doom might be well-received but I personally couldn't get into doom and I just see their new game as a rebrand.

The latter two are harder to get right for so many games and the Battlenet on PC makes it unnecessarily complicated like with Diablo 4.

I'm in my mid 30s but I much preferred the showcase events of all the big 3 at E3, I want to be hyped / inspired to play a must- have game, with a human providing a introductory story and explanation of what I am about to see. Like getting (~Hideo Kojima~ edit, cant strike through this) the games lead art director on stage to explain the tech behind Snake Eater remake would have been cool, as an example. The quick fire trailer after trailer where I only learn the game that was shown after the trailer, and with only a few sentences spoke by humans at seemingly random interval's is not a format I personally am a fan of. And they could have really sold the new hardware they are releasing but it they spent 30 seconds on it. How is that going to make me want to buy one, the new Galaxy colour for the 2TB series X looks cool but wheres all the buttering up gone?  All that said, some great games were shown today.",31,7,Positive,Happy,Game

Last year it was the extended showcase (I assumed we'd get that again, but they haven't specified so I'm not sure the medium, hopefully not just xbox wire articles). But they go into tech and stuff there.   The big miss from E3 is the convention atmosphere and on-site presence. A live digital showcase case just isn't really ""live"". Even just playing the prepared showcase at a major onsite venue is just different. Nothing I've seen of Xbox Fanfest or Summer Game Fest really replicates this. I never got to go to E3 myself, but I have started going to major conventions like MCM London and even stuff like the Sonic Symphony and the vibe just hits so different. In comparison the ""not-E3s"" all feel just too ""controlled"".   I think Microsoft is probably in the best position now with all the first party content they own to put on a major comic con level convention in the summer around the showcase to bring gamers together. And I really think they should. It'd do so much for the Xbox brand (which gets so much hate or is just ignored or unknown because Microsoft doesn't market it) and make it a center of gaming. These past few showcases have shown a major dedication in working with partners for huge third party reveals. They should bank on that. They don't want to make every third party game exclusive like Sony. That's fine but they still need to do something to tell people to buy an Xbox to play those games.

They will be able to to that with Black Ops 6 as theyre already doing with Diablo IV, but putting Black Ops 1, 2, 3 or any older title theres little to none they could further monetize on those games, plus the real problem is that older games can eat into the audience of the current games which are way more profitable, now you get the issue?

Uncharted has much better stories, much tighter gameplay, and much better set pieces to where you feel youre in an action movie. The first uncharted is a bit worse than the rest of them but still solid. A big difference is that tomb raider is semi-open world, with random objects and collectibles dotted around, I think there was crafting too. Uncharted is linear, no crafting at all, and is overall a very polished and concise experience (you can beat them all in like 10-12 hours each first time through).  What I love about uncharted is they really know what theyre trying to do and stick to it. Even on ps3 the graphics were great for what they were, stories are awesome, puzzles are fun, and Nathan drake throws around great one liners. I would definitely recommend everyone play through the uncharted series at least once.  So I did enjoy both series, but overall I just like the well curated gameplay of uncharted.

Xbox Games Showcase,Reddit,ReservoirDog316,"Well thats my point. Sony is *so* radically out in first place ahead of Xbox that theyre complacent. Xbox is on the ropes so they finally come out swinging.   Now to be clear, I think its a bit more complicated than just that since I think Covid delays from years ago did leave a gap in their release schedule, on top of TLoU live service game being canceled when it was presumably gonna be Sonys big release of l fall 2024. But in a broader picture, Sony seems to have lost its way a bit by focusing away from their strengths and instead on live service stuff that isnt panning out. I will say I *really* appreciate that theyd just allow ND to cancel that TLoU live service game instead of releasing it and sullying their spotless record (seriously, imagine Jak 3 being the worst? game they ever released, insane stuff). People were critical of that but think how much respect they have for ND to just cancel a game that was presumably really far along in development. Live service games have launched with meager amounts of content at full price so they couldve done it but didnt.   But still, Sony needs to have a feel some competition to get back on the ball. I do believe if they revealed the stuff they currently have cooking from Sucker Punch and Insomniac and ND and all their other devs, it would be a little more even, but that stuff is probably late 2025 at best, so whatever. I personally like when they reveal stuff thats a long ways off but I know Im in the minority there.",1,1,Positive,Happy,Game

Xbox Games Showcase,Reddit,Unknown_User261,"Unfortunately this isn't anything new. Xbox has an awful habit of dumping everything in the fall season. They could literally do their ""one AAA first party game a quarter"" if they figured out this. Last year was the most releases Xbox has done in the first half in a while (Hi-Fi, AOE console, Legends, Redfall) and only two were really good. Summer was dry as usual and then all their heavy hitters came out back to back in fall. Its actually starting to look like a problem if they stick to these release dates with how much Xbox first party games are going to compete with themselves all day one on Game Pass. Yeah, people won't have to buy one or the other but they still only have limited time. That's not even counting all the third party fall releases.

You get more exp if you don't kill people. In the game series made famous for showing an xray  view of your bullet destroying nazi testicles. It's weird.  The game is also MUCH less forgiving in terms of detection so if you don't have a perfect stealth build, sniping is going to attract attention and get literally dozens of soldiers on you. The level design makes it very hard to avoid gunfights. I can't remember EVER using my SMG in the first game. I used it constantly in 5, and that was while save scumming constantly to avoid alarms.  It's not a bad game, but all of the new mechanics and level design detract from the major reason anyone plays the series, which is shooting nazis in the dick and watching the bullet obliterate each organ on the way in and out.
