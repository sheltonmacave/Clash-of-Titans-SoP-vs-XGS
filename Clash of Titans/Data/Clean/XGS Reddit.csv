Zero_MaverickHunterX,"This was legit an all time great showcase.   DOOM looks amazing Expedition 33 looks amazing Perfect Dark  looks amazing Flintlock looks great Avowed is looking fantastic now Indiana Jones looks really strong STALKER 2 looks next level South of Midnight looks really great Atomfall looks really great AND They showed a new GEARS finally. All of which are coming to Game Pass DAY ONE and then some.   Oh, and Black Ops 6 actually looks really great as well. MS knocked it totally out of the park with this one",439,10

Virtual-Face,"One of the better shows in my opinion. Lots a big titles, no useless talking in-between. Loved it.",109,2
ShopCartRicky,"Fable, Avowed, Perfect Dark, Dragon Age and Expedition 33 all looked great imo.",189,6
supermightymatt,Some great games shown but why are they sitting on the Activision games catalogue and not putting them on gamepass,265,10
br1k,"I'm getting massively hyped for Indiana Jones. It shapes up as a full fat Indy adventure, also looks much better than on the last presentation.",55,3
TheCookieButter,No Banjo Kazooie :(,22,3

therealist11,Amazing showcase. This is how its done.,49,0
AresOneX,Really good showcase! The best one we had in years imo. Maybe even in a decade. The only letdown for me was no handheld announcement. But the games were on fire!!,70,1

outla5t,"Honestly best game showcase I've seen in years and best Xbox showcase in a decade or so. Lots of great games shown including Perfect Dark, Gears, Fable, DOOM, Indiana Jones, and Diablo IV expansion with some excellent looking third party games including Dragon Age, Wuchang, Stalker 2, and South of Midnight. Just banger after banger after banger, that's the way you put on a show well done Xbox.",8,0

Turbostrider27,"Easily 9/10 or possibly a 10/10   The only thing I was bummed about is no release dates for big titles like Avowed and Indiana Jones. Otherwise, best showcase, on par if not better than Microsoft's E3 2018.",9,0

PepsiSheep,"Great show, however:  Where is the ABK library on Game Pass? Where are the dates for 2024 games? Indy and Avowed look great but you can't even lock in a month?  Why don't we have an ID@Xbox section or much from the partners?  8/10 show, and some amazing games. But as a consumer it's a touch, just a touch, frustrating.",51,6

Johncurtisreeve,"AMAZING SHOWCASE.  Was shocked about Gears EDAY which is really cool, but what about gears 6?  Surely that must be happening?  It was really cool to finally see PERFECT DARK and Fable both look amazing.  Just about everything in the showcase was BOMB.  DOOM absolutely stole the show for me and Im actually excited for the new COD which I haven't been in years.",4,1

Kami_Blake_Aur,"I liked it. Was worried how much the black ops direct would cut in with only 2 hours reported, so I was so excited as soon as Phil confirmed it'd only be like 30 minutes. The showcase ended up feeling longer than usual.   My only two complaints were no Halo (it could have joined the live service brigade with a <2min long trailer just to show Xbox still remembers the IP",3,

Quitsquirrel,Hopefully Avowed and Indy make 2024. It was a little worrisome that they didn't have set release dates. Either way both look amazing and can't wait to dive in.  Perfect Dark looks amazing and I can't wait for that either!,9,2
Blitzindamorning,"Pros/likes: Doom, Avowed, BO6, Perfect Dark, Indiana Jones, Atom Fall, MGS Delta, and STALKER  Cons/dislikes: Oddly placed games (Winter Burrow and WoW), Flight Sim again, and no older AB games on Gamepass.  Also, all those ""insiders"" are full of crock.",13,3

Caesar_35,"Fantastic showcase with a fantastic Grand Prix right after. What a night!  Indy's my biggest favourite, and Starfield DLC and STALKER. Flintlock, Avowed, South of Midnight, State of Decay, and Fable are also looking great. Atomfall was a nice surprise too. Looks a lot like British Fallout? All those should more than cover my Gamepass subscription for the next couple of years. Bit of Pat Benatar during ESO was a treat too.  Was really hoping for the old CoD's on gamepass (muh MW2 Spec Ops, since I'm always too lazy to change discs) and something for Ara and Elder Scrolls VI - optimistic on that one, I know. Soon for all of them, I hope.",2,0

Chicken65,Why would anyone get the Series X Digital (white)?

But the Series X All Digital is $50 MORE than the Series X original which is on sale right now AND it has less features (no disc drive). Am I missing something?

Now I hope they all deliver in a massive way. Im atleast fully confident about DOOM.  The 3 new hardware reveals were surprising and underwhelming. I was expecting the new Sebile controller and the 2TB all-digital cylindrical Series X that were leaked, but I guess they never went ahead with both internally. Instead we get a 1TB all-digital white Series X, a 1TB white Series S and a 2TB black Series X.",1,0

Tangentkoala,My conspiracy theory Is that Microsoft is convincing the call of duty peeps to bundle all their add ons so they force the consumer to buy more storage space.    218 GB for COD is ridiculous.

Most of what was shown is what we've seen in previous years, not that much to be excited for but I think Fable is meant to be a standout game that's why it's taking so long. Compulsion Games has some good themes and could have an indie hit on their hands with South of Midnight.  I think doom might be well-received but I personally couldn't get into doom and I just see their new game as a rebrand.

Maybe they're going to merge Xbox app and Battlenet and that's taking time, and they don't want to release things iteratively as PC and Cloud are important for first party.",2,0

Unknown_User261,"I mean we still have a week of deep dives. Last year it was the extended showcase (I assumed we'd get that again, but they haven't specified so I'm not sure the medium, hopefully not just xbox wire articles). But they go into tech and stuff there.   The big miss from E3 is the convention atmosphere and on-site presence. A live digital showcase case just isn't really ""live"". Even just playing the prepared showcase at a major onsite venue is just different. Nothing I've seen of Xbox Fanfest or Summer Game Fest really replicates this. I never got to go to E3 myself, but I have started going to major conventions like MCM London and even stuff like the Sonic Symphony and the vibe just hits so different. In comparison the ""not-E3s"" all feel just too ""controlled"".   I think Microsoft is probably in the best position now with all the first party content they own to put on a major comic con level convention in the summer around the showcase to bring gamers together. And I really think they should. It'd do so much for the Xbox brand (which gets so much hate or is just ignored or unknown because Microsoft doesn't market it) and make it a center of gaming. These past few showcases have shown a major dedication in working with partners for huge third party reveals. They should bank on that. They don't want to make every third party game exclusive like Sony. That's fine but they still need to do something to tell people to buy an Xbox to play those games.

Uncharted has much better stories, much tighter gameplay, and much better set pieces to where you feel youre in an action movie. The first uncharted is a bit worse than the rest of them but still solid. A big difference is that tomb raider is semi-open world, with random objects and collectibles dotted around, I think there was crafting too. Uncharted is linear, no crafting at all, and is overall a very polished and concise experience (you can beat them all in like 10-12 hours each first time through).  What I love about uncharted is they really know what theyre trying to do and stick to it. Even on ps3 the graphics were great for what they were, stories are awesome, puzzles are fun, and Nathan drake throws around great one liners. I would definitely recommend everyone play through the uncharted series at least once.  So I did enjoy both series, but overall I just like the well curated gameplay of uncharted.

Now to be clear, I think its a bit more complicated than just that since I think Covid delays from years ago did leave a gap in their release schedule, on top of TLoU live service game being canceled when it was presumably gonna be Sonys big release of l fall 2024. But in a broader picture, Sony seems to have lost its way a bit by focusing away from their strengths and instead on live service stuff that isnt panning out. I will say I *really* appreciate that theyd just allow ND to cancel that TLoU live service game instead of releasing it and sullying their spotless record (seriously, imagine Jak 3 being the worst game they ever released, insane stuff). People were critical of that but think how much respect they have for ND to just cancel a game that was presumably really far along in development. Live service games have launched with meager amounts of content at full price so they couldve done it but didnt.   But still, Sony needs to have a feel some competition to get back on the ball. I do believe if they revealed the stuff they currently have cooking from Sucker Punch and Insomniac and ND and all their other devs, it would be a little more even, but that stuff is probably late 2025 at best, so whatever. I personally like when they reveal stuff thats a long ways off but I know Im in the minority there.",1,1

Summer was dry as usual and then all their heavy hitters came out back to back in fall. Its actually starting to look like a problem if they stick to these release dates with how much Xbox first party games are going to compete with themselves all day one on Game Pass. Yeah, people won't have to buy one or the other but they still only have limited time. That's not even counting all the third party fall releases.

You get more exp if you don't kill people. In the game series made famous for showing an xray  view of your bullet destroying nazi testicles. It's weird.  The game is also MUCH less forgiving in terms of detection so if you don't have a perfect stealth build, sniping is going to attract attention and get literally dozens of soldiers on you. The level design makes it very hard to avoid gunfights. I can't remember EVER using my SMG in the first game. I used it constantly in 5, and that was while save scumming constantly to avoid alarms.  It's not a bad game, but all of the new mechanics and level design detract from the major reason anyone plays the series, which is shooting nazis in the dick and watching the bullet obliterate each organ on the way in and out.
