@gavinbarnett97,"@jack.kennedyy420 ratchet and clank guns are the definition of variety. I don't think you know what that franchise is. No rpgs?

Ff7 rebirth is an rpg. Even the new gow games could be argued to be a action rpg. Learn the definition of rpg because there is more than just turn based.",0,6/15/2024,4 PM,0
@gavinbarnett97,"@jack.kennedyy420 I mentioned guns because that is where the variety comes in with ratchet and clank.

@gavinbarnett97,"@jack.kennedyy420 ghost of tsushima is, at least it was labeled rpg on the store. And half of the rpgs don't soundtrack because you don't care? That doesn't make sense. You may not like persona but a lot of people do.  And again xbox has a couple of games not on pc but the rest are. That's because microsoft makes pcs. Even game pass is on pc.

@gavinbarnett97,"@jack.kennedyy420 I'm not checking if these games are on pc, because even if they are the only console you can play them on is playstation. These are all rpgs:  Horizon zero dawn, Horizon Forbidden west, bloodeborne, possibly the newer gow games, the original persona 5,  ff16, ff7 remake, and ff7 rebirth. And I understand persona being everywhere because you can get royal anywhere, but ff16 is only on ps5 and pc, and ff7 rebirth is only on ps5 so saying it is avaliable everywhere is just incorrect.",0,6/16/2024,12 PM,0
