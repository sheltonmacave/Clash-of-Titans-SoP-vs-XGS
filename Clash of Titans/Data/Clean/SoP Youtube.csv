@IMightJustGetMe,"Literally the worst state of play by far! No big announcements, no surprises, nothing we want at all (except astro)........ With Xbox failing as bad as it is right now, you'd have thought Sony would have taken this time to put a nail in it's coffin, but instead...... it's like it's trying to compete with them for who can fall the hardest! Very disappointed.",0,2 weeks ago
@tommytelstar,This was a live Service and PC show. Sony frequent contempt for its own fans is ongoing. And Sony desperation to fill the multi=player vacuum is embarrassing. The PR sham of starting a  5v5 game like it's a Sony style single player game is transparent BS. Sony is scum and always will be. Just like the other 2 platforms.,0,2 weeks ago

@EvilWorldOfGreed-do1ox,"Playstation State Of Play is that consoles are seriously lacking in CPU and GPU compute power, slowing the progress of PC gaming to a snails pace. You can witness this simply by the typical slashers on show here and in all open world games. There are only a pathetic one or three NPC's using asset instances rendered to be animated on screen at one time hence the CPU and GPU compute power is seriously lacking. Games are released for the least hardware capable devices being consoles for compatibility reasons. For this reason consoles are slowing down more capable PC hardware gaming. It's a joke that in 2024 games cannot render varied animated worlds with thousands of varied fully animated game assets all with different proportions without the need for copied game asset instancing.",0,2 weeks ago
