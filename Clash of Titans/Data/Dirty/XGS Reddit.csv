Zero_MaverickHunterX,439,"This was legit an all time great showcase.   DOOM looks amazing Expedition 33 looks amazing Perfect Dark  looks amazing Flintlock looks great Avowed is looking fantastic now Indiana Jones looks really strong STALKER 2 looks next level South of Midnight looks really great Atomfall looks really great AND They showed a new GEARS finally. All of which are coming to Game Pass DAY ONE and then some.   Oh, and Black Ops 6 actually looks really great as well. MS knocked it totally out of the park with this one",10

Virtual-Face,109,"One of the better shows in my opinion. Lots a big titles, no useless talking in-between. Loved it.",2
ShopCartRicky,189,"Fable, Avowed, Perfect Dark, Dragon Age and Expedition 33 all looked great imo.",6
supermightymatt,265,Some great games shown but why are they sitting on the Activision games catalogue and not putting them on gamepass,10
br1k,55,"I'm getting massively hyped for Indiana Jones. It shapes up as a full fat Indy adventure, also looks much better than on the last presentation.",3

therealist11,49,Amazing showcase. This is how it‚Äôs done.,0
AresOneX,70,Really good showcase! The best one we had in years imo. Maybe even in a decade. The only letdown for me was no handheld announcement. But the games were on fire!!,1
Laughing__Man_,24,"I liked it, waiting for Flintlock, Fable and Avowed.   Wanna see more of Perfect Dark before I get to excited.  And of course Indy was a highlight.",1
Galactus1701,28,I‚Äôm happy with Gears 6 and DOOM Dark Ages.,2
MrMusou,22,Gears will likely get me on Game Pass again but who knows when we‚Äôll get more info on that. Rest of the show was solid but no real surprises.,2

TheDarkRedKnight,50,"I was hoping for a mascot platformer, whether that‚Äôs Crash, Banjo, Spyro or any of the other characters they own but are sitting on.   Too many highly-detailed sci-fi/East Asia/fantasy action RPGs.",5
outla5t,8,"Honestly best game showcase I've seen in years and best Xbox showcase in a decade or so. Lots of great games shown including Perfect Dark, Gears, Fable, DOOM, Indiana Jones, and Diablo IV expansion with some excellent looking third party games including Dragon Age, Wuchang, Stalker 2, and South of Midnight. Just banger after banger after banger, that's the way you put on a show well done Xbox.",0
Couinty,15,it was so good,0
Golden-Event-Horizon,23,It's now been *checks watch* 4 years since Everwild has been last shown,3
Turbostrider27,9,"Easily 9/10 or possibly a 10/10   The only thing I was bummed about is no release dates for big titles like Avowed and Indiana Jones. Otherwise, best showcase, on par if not better than Microsoft's E3 2018.",0

ElementEnigma,35,F in the chat for Halo I guess,5

king_noro,4,"I feel weird saying this because it still *feels* like we're early on in this console generation, but if even 80% of what we saw deliver on their potential, I'm going to feel like I got my money's worth with the Series X.  We have so much to look forward to over the next 2-3 years.",1

SHADOWSTRIKE1,17,Another year where Microsoft just sits on the Banjo-Kazooie IP‚Ä¶,2
Accomplished-Ad5280,8,A new DOOM! Looks awesome! Hope it will be sound great as Eternal was,0
PepsiSheep,51,"Great show, however:  Where is the ABK library on Game Pass? Where are the dates for 2024 games? Indy and Avowed look great but you can't even lock in a month?  Why don't we have an ID@Xbox section or much from the partners?  8/10 show, and some amazing games. But as a consumer it's a touch, just a touch, frustrating.",6
sludgezone,3,I wanted a new Heretic/Hexen but fuck it I‚Äôll take dark fantasy Doom. Perfect Dark looks sick too.,0
seantenk,4,We are so back,0
MrFOrzum,2,"Might have been one of the best Xbox showcases in many, many years, if not even the best one they‚Äôve ever done. Tons of good stuff here. Imagine how empty it would have been without the Bethesda & activision purchase lol.   Stalker looks insane.",0
Josh261995,4,One of the best showcases,0
Johncurtisreeve,4,"AMAZING SHOWCASE.  Was shocked about Gears EDAY which is really cool, but what about gears 6?  Surely that must be happening?  It was really cool to finally see PERFECT DARK and Fable both look amazing.  Just about everything in the showcase was BOMB.  DOOM absolutely stole the show for me and Im actually excited for the new COD which I haven't been in years.",1
Mental-Macaroon8153,3,"Dragon Age, Indiana Jones and Atomfall are definite buys.",0
ATrollByNoOtherName,4,What a showcase!  That Doom reveal and gameplay incredible. Holy shit!  Gears going back to early days is a nice surprise.  So many bangers here.,0
Luxowell,4,Mixtape was obviously created by a team my exact age and I'm fucking here for it!,0
Kami_Blake_Aur,3,"I liked it. Was worried how much the black ops direct would cut in with only 2 hours reported, so I was so excited as soon as Phil confirmed it'd only be like 30 minutes. The showcase ended up feeling longer than usual.   My only two complaints were no Halo (it could have joined the live service brigade with a <2min long trailer just to show Xbox still remembers the IP; ESO got a long-behind trailer for an expansion that's already launched on PC), and a complete lack of real platform or ecosystem announcements. The hardware reveal at the end was awful. I wasn't expecting a handheld (I saw BS on that rumor a mile away; plus it'd mean its a generation behind in 2 years according to other rumors), but anything from an update on Xcloud to just that they're working with ABK to make new games backwards compatible would have been nice. I think an Xbox Showcase (the only time everyone's eyes are on Xbox and gamers all around are talking positively) should really have a ""this is why you should game ON Xbox"" moment.  At any rate, Xbox's showcase is closer to replacing E3 then Summer Game Fest with all the hype reveals. If I were them I'd bank on this for future years. Get the Xbox brand out there and make it associated with gaming globally.",0
DarkestDisco,3,"#Get out of here, stalker",0
Raecino,3,"Well I‚Äôll finally get a Series X, the 2TB one.  Kind of disappointed there wasn‚Äôt a redesign of the console though.  I thought the cylindrical design they showed in the mockups was looking good.",1

maba_sehiko,3,huge improvement from last year. i was kinda expecting some shadow drop but dragon age releasing this year is hype.,0

kinggeorgetheiv,3,"Really strong batch of games and trailers. A LOT of fantasy. I was constantly thinking ‚Äúohhh this is fable.. no.. oh THIS is fable..‚Äù. not that i mind, these fantasy titles look super nice and the genre/world type takes full advantage of next gem hardware",0

WheySoldier,6,"Best video game showcase in a while. Loved almost everything they showed.   Finally, Xbox! It's what we've been waiting for.",0
scole44,6,Avowed honestly was not what I was hoping it was going to be. Looks a little more cartoony than I'd hoped after seeing that great trailer a couple years back. Hope it doesn't turn out bad.,0
Quitsquirrel,9,Hopefully Avowed and Indy make 2024. It was a little worrisome that they didn't have set release dates. Either way both look amazing and can't wait to dive in.  Perfect Dark looks amazing and I can't wait for that either!,2
Blitzindamorning,13,"Pros/likes: Doom, Avowed, BO6, Perfect Dark, Indiana Jones, Atom Fall, MGS Delta, and STALKER  Cons/dislikes: Oddly placed games (Winter Burrow and WoW), Flight Sim again, and no older AB games on Gamepass.  Also, all those ""insiders"" are full of crock.",3
konanorigami,4,Diablo and elder scrolls got me! What an amazing showcase!,0
Worldly_Fuel6483,4,"State Of Play & Game Fest were pretty awful but this Xbox Showcase was S TIER LEVELS of Kino.¬† I know there's the joke that this series of modern consoles has No Games but my God it was good.

DontToewsM3Bro,2,Great show   8/10  Hopefully the games live up to hype,0
Caesar_35,2,"Fantastic showcase with a fantastic Grand Prix right after. What a night!  Indy's my biggest favourite, and Starfield DLC and STALKER. Flintlock, Avowed, South of Midnight, State of Decay, and Fable are also looking great. Atomfall was a nice surprise too. Looks a lot like British Fallout? All those should more than cover my Gamepass subscription for the next couple of years. Bit of Pat Benatar during ESO was a treat too.  Was really hoping for the old CoD's on gamepass (muh MW2 Spec Ops, since I'm always too lazy to change discs) and something for Ara and Elder Scrolls VI - optimistic on that one, I know. Soon for all of them, I hope.",0

KidGoku1,1,The only disappointing thing about this showcase was no ABK specifically COD game released on gamepass today. Was really hoping for any black ops game to drop in gamepass today so i could play zombies with my friends.,1

Chicken65,1,Why would anyone get the Series X Digital (white)? I‚Äôm bummed because I usually wait for the mid gen refresh to enter into a console generation because you either get a lower price or a small upgrade somehow. But the Series X All Digital is $50 MORE than the Series X original which is on sale right now AND it has less features (no disc drive). Am I missing something?

Danvanmarvellfan,1,There is something off about fable. I want to love it but I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to be a dud. I want to be wrong so bad. Same thing with perfect dark it‚Äôs giving me cyberpunk vibes where it looks almost too good to be real,0

Bolt_995,1,"A very, very well done show, with great showcases for DOOM: The Dark Ages, Perfect Dark, Fable and Gears of War: E-Day. Gave me almost Sony E3 2016 vibes.   Now I hope they all deliver in a massive way. I‚Äôm atleast fully confident about DOOM.  The 3 new hardware reveals were surprising and underwhelming. I was expecting the new Sebile controller and the 2TB all-digital cylindrical Series X that were leaked, but I guess they never went ahead with both internally. Instead we get a 1TB all-digital white Series X, a 1TB white Series S and a 2TB black Series X.",0

I can't believe it's been like 6 years since we were first shown Perfect Dark, Fable and Avowed and they STILL don't have concrete release dates.   I also think they should've dropped the Series S. How do you show off a new Series X when you're just handcuffing people who buy it because of the Series S?",1

DocBrutus,7,I lit up when I saw Fable. It‚Äôs my favorite game series.,1
blackamerigan,1,"Yeah it was finally, finally, finally good to see some gameplay from some of these studios... Most of what was shown is what we've seen in previous years, not that much to be excited for but I think Fable is meant to be a standout game that's why it's taking so long. Compulsion Games has some good themes and could have an indie hit on their hands with South of Midnight.  I think doom might be well-received but I personally couldn't get into doom and I just see their new game as a rebrand. Idk I didn't find any of the showcase to be that interesting but maybe I'm more into indie games, more than I am call of duty.",1

This new style of content consumption is kind of sickening, attention spans are shot and people act as if they don't have time for banter/filler.

LZR0,83,"My guess is to not cannibalize on the games they can actually further monetize with expansions, upgrades, MTX, battle passes, and all that.

bogas04,2,"I¬†think¬†it's also¬†hard, apart from a systematically better thing to do to make more money. They¬†usually¬†bring¬†games to Xbox, PC, Cloud with touch controls. The latter two are harder to get right for so many games and the Battlenet on PC makes it unnecessarily complicated like with Diablo 4. Maybe they're going to merge Xbox app and Battlenet and that's taking time, and they don't want to release things iteratively as PC and Cloud are important for first party.",0

Unknown_User261,1,"My hope is that this is the year Xbox does a ""direct"" every quarter to announce release dates 3 months out. I just know that's probably not going to be the case. The problem with no release dates is Xbox only has 2 major first party shows a year (and that's somehow a vast improvement from last gen). A developer direct in January and a showcase in June. Xbox should do a better job at consistent times people can expect to hear updates about all their ""coming soon"" titles.",0

Unknown_User261,8,"I mean we still have a week of deep dives. Last year it was the extended showcase (I assumed we'd get that again, but they haven't specified so I'm not sure the medium, hopefully not just xbox wire articles). But they go into tech and stuff there.   The big miss from E3 is the convention atmosphere and on-site presence. A live digital showcase case just isn't really ""live"". Even just playing the prepared showcase at a major onsite venue is just different. Nothing I've seen of Xbox Fanfest or Summer Game Fest really replicates this. I never got to go to E3 myself, but I have started going to major conventions like MCM London and even stuff like the Sonic Symphony and the vibe just hits so different. In comparison the ""not-E3s"" all feel just too ""controlled"".   I think Microsoft is probably in the best position now with all the first party content they own to put on a major comic con level convention in the summer around the showcase to bring gamers together. And I really think they should. It'd do so much for the Xbox brand (which gets so much hate or is just ignored or unknown because Microsoft doesn't market it) and make it a center of gaming. These past few showcases have shown a major dedication in working with partners for huge third party reveals. They should bank on that. They don't want to make every third party game exclusive like Sony. That's fine but they still need to do something to tell people to buy an Xbox to play those games. Creating an E3 where Xbox branding is everywhere would be one way.",0

They will be able to to that with Black Ops 6 as they‚Äôre already doing with Diablo IV, but putting Black Ops 1, 2, 3 or any older title there‚Äôs little to none they could further monetize on those games, plus the real problem is that older games can eat into the audience of the current games which are way more profitable, now you get the issue?

shockwave8428,2,"I would say uncharted is by far better than tomb raider personally (uncharted is my fave game series ever), but tomb raider is still great. Uncharted has much better stories, much tighter gameplay, and much better set pieces to where you feel you‚Äôre in an action movie. The first uncharted is a bit worse than the rest of them but still solid. A big difference is that tomb raider is semi-open world, with random objects and collectibles dotted around, I think there was crafting too. Uncharted is linear, no crafting at all, and is overall a very polished and concise experience (you can beat them all in like 10-12 hours each first time through).  What I love about uncharted is they really know what they‚Äôre trying to do and stick to it. Even on ps3 the graphics were great for what they were, stories are awesome, puzzles are fun, and Nathan drake throws around great one liners. I would definitely recommend everyone play through the uncharted series at least once.  So I did enjoy both series, but overall I just like the well curated gameplay of uncharted.

ReservoirDog316,1,"Well that‚Äôs my point. Sony is *so* radically out in first place ahead of Xbox that they‚Äôre complacent. Xbox is on the ropes so they finally come out swinging.   Now to be clear, I think it‚Äôs a bit more complicated than just that since I think Covid delays from years ago did leave a gap in their release schedule, on top of TLoU live service game being canceled when it was presumably gonna be Sony‚Äôs big release of l fall 2024. But in a broader picture, Sony seems to have lost its way a bit by focusing away from their strengths and instead on live service stuff that isn‚Äôt panning out. I will say I *really* appreciate that they‚Äôd just allow ND to cancel that TLoU live service game instead of releasing it and sullying their spotless record (seriously, imagine Jak 3 being the ‚Äúworst‚Äù game they ever released, insane stuff). People were critical of that but think how much respect they have for ND to just cancel a game that was presumably really far along in development. Live service games have launched with meager amounts of content at full price so they could‚Äôve done it but didn‚Äôt.   But still, Sony needs to have a feel some competition to get back on the ball. I do believe if they revealed the stuff they currently have cooking from Sucker Punch and Insomniac and ND and all their other devs, it would be a little more even, but that stuff is probably late 2025 at best, so whatever. I personally like when they reveal stuff that‚Äôs a long ways off but I know I‚Äôm in the minority there.",1

They could literally do their ""one AAA first party game a quarter"" if they figured out this. Last year was the most releases Xbox has done in the first half in a while (Hi-Fi, AOE console, Legends, Redfall) and only two were really good. Summer was dry as usual and then all their heavy hitters came out back to back in fall. Its actually starting to look like a problem if they stick to these release dates with how much Xbox first party games are going to compete with themselves all day one on Game Pass. Yeah, people won't have to buy one or the other but they still only have limited time. That's not even counting all the third party fall releases.

TabularBeastv2,1,"Obviously you have to take these things with a grain of salt but supposedly they are working on a game with Microsoft, and that it‚Äôs Spyro 4.   Source: https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-4-reportedly-in-early-development-at-toys-for-bob",1
Chelmicus,1,Skylanders‚Ä¶ I can always dream,0
deaf_michael_scott,-1,So BO6 could launch on GP but 10-year old COD games couldn't?  And games like Spyro and Tony Hawk also couldn't join GP?  LOL sure,1
North_Onyx,0,"If they're in a good spot now, I don't want them to take 6 years just to release another soft reboot",1
Uncircled_swag2,5,"Man, we really got a new Gears or Halo every year from 2006 through 2013 (even longer if you count MCC and the Gears 1 Ultimate Edition)  Weird to think there‚Äôs only been 1 of each in the last 5 years",0
michaelje0,5,That‚Äôs not who I responded to.,1
Good_ApoIIo,1,Ah so it wasn‚Äôt just me. 5 was cool in its own way but it basically felt like a less interesting Hitman because all I did was sneak around and shoot people with my silenced pistol and hide the bodies. It seemed like the only gameplay strategy that made sense in that one. Got old after awhile.,0
AveryLazyCovfefe,0,What the hell are your last 2 paragraphs.  Are you being serious? what the hell. I freakin loved 4 and was interested because 5 is on gamepass. That's revolting that they did that.,1
NotAnotherAmerican,-2,"I walked up to an enemy and he looked at me and did nothing. It happened a couple of times. I love my sniper elite, but 5 was uninstalled in 4 hours. I'm not hating, I mean I kind of am, but they didn't do a good job making it.",0
IssueRecent9134,2,"I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt care who wins or loses, I just want to play games.",1
King_Sam-_-,1,I wanted to say that but I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was jumping the gun lol.,0
Ok-fine-man,1,I got three years on the loophole Xbox Live method last year. The past year has taken the actual piss. Just nothing but old games.,1

Vostroyan212th,5,I don't think you are as familiar with DA as you claim yo be. The trailer felt like the fantasy equivalent of a heist film trailer,1
LZR0,1,Didn‚Äôt you hear that alone ain‚Äôt enough to make up for selling games at full price?,0
RobertdBanks,1,So where does this story even lead then? It‚Äôs not a reboot. If the studio couldn‚Äôt make a worthwhile new trilogy then you somehow have faith that they‚Äôll do well with a *prequel* of all things? They‚Äôre literally just going to do a game full of fan service as seen with this trailer using Mad World. Spare me the cheap fan service.,0
RobertdBanks,2,"The original trilogy I specifically played for the story first and everything else second. The Coalition not being able to get people interested in their new story just makes this seem all the more like a cheap way to play fan service. ‚ÄúMarcus and Dom are back fellas!‚Äù  I like Goodfellas, that doesn‚Äôt mean I want a Goodfellas prequel that brings characters back and shows me their unnecessary origin stories.",0
RobertdBanks,-1,"What lingering questions are there that the prequel will set out to answer?   I‚Äôm a fan of Gears, the Marcus and Dom story wrapped and that initial trilogy ended and ended well. The Coalition not being able to put together a worthwhile story and new trilogy (or however many games) doesn‚Äôt really inspire a lot of faith in me and this just seems like a cheap way to play fan service.   ‚ÄúYou guys remember Marcus and Dom??? Well guess what??? They‚Äôre back!‚Äù   It just seems cheap imo. Their story wrapped, this just seems unnecessary.",1
LKN-115,1,"If that's the case, the lay-offs make no sense. And neither would them splitting off from Microsoft either. I guess we'll see in time",0
LKN-115,1,"The article is from March tbf, it very well could've changed since. I hope I'm wrong in any case, I think they could do a pretty good job with it",0
None,1,[removed],1
Sharp-Pop335,0,"Aren't they doing another halo ce remaster? For all the lore halo has they really don't want to cut ties with chief. Give us a game based around contact harvest or ghosts of onyx. Or a game where you're an oni agent doing halseys dirty work or something.  Another odst, anything.",0
Jerry_from_Japan,-4,Uhhh you responded to someone who agrees with that post lol.,0
calvinien,5,"It's exaggeration. The game tries to be more like metal gear. So the optimum solution in most situations is to sneak up on a guy and choke him out.  You get more exp if you don't kill people. In the game series made famous for showing an xray  view of your bullet destroying nazi testicles. It's weird.  The game is also MUCH less forgiving in terms of detection so if you don't have a perfect stealth build, sniping is going to attract attention and get literally dozens of soldiers on you. The level design makes it very hard to avoid gunfights. I can't remember EVER using my SMG in the first game. I used it constantly in 5, and that was while save scumming constantly to avoid alarms.  It's not a bad game, but all of the new mechanics and level design detract from the major reason anyone plays the series, which is shooting nazis in the dick and watching the bullet obliterate each organ on the way in and out.  It's more Commando Elite than Sniper elite.  &#x200B;  Let me put it this way...I discovered the nut shot cam by accident in previous games...and I couldn't get it to trigger in this one. I don't even know if it exists in 5.     It' like playing gears without the curb stomp.",2
ReservoirDog316,1,Yeah that‚Äôs the point. The best thing that can happen is both sides competing and firing on all cylinders. They‚Äôre trying to win but we‚Äôre the real winners.,0
None,2,"It‚Äôs why I canceled, it‚Äôs cheaper to just buy the games I want than pay a sub for games I don‚Äôt.",0
ShopCartRicky,1,Why wouldn't that feel like Dragon Age when Varric is the focal point of the trailer? Are you sure you know Dragon Age?,2
Gearsman133,3,"But this is during e day, about 13 years before gears of war 1. There's plenty of story to be told about young Marcus and Dom. Plus nobody cares about the swarm or kait, this is just infinitely more interesting than that.",0
deaf_michael_scott,-1,Very logical rebuttal.  I‚Äôm convinced.,1
Enabler0,1,The name of the game is so generic.  Does it have any sort of story or is it literally a sniping simulator,1
Sux499,0,Sounds like a you issue.,1
Vostroyan212th,5,"Look, I'll he happy to be wrong, but after inquisition and andromeda I have little faith in bioware, and this looks and presents itself as both a hero shooter and a heist film. I want a fantasy epic, and not a Guy Ritchie fantasy from a studio whose best years are 15 years behind them.",1
ScottSterling77,0,When did you start playing Dragon Age games?,1
Imthecoolestdudeever,2,No one would convince you. You've made your stance very clear.,1
calvinien,2,"Oh it has a story. I just can't remember it despite playing the game last month.  The story of all of the sniper elite games is usually some variant of ""NAZI GUY IS DOING A BAD! FIND OUT AND STOP HIM.""  There's usually a plot point about sabotaging some nazi superweapon like the V2's or the Ratte. The story is not why you are playing.  You are playing because gun go pew pew nazi go boom. Wolfenstein this aint.",0
WillBeBetter2023,3,And me.  Everyone loves shooting Nazi testicles,0
ShopCartRicky,1,"Personally, outside of spending too much time in the Hinterlands, Inquisition was great imo, especially the DLC. Andromeda was fine. Done a disservice by being in the Mass Effect universe because it obviously doesn't come close to the trilogy.",0
ShopCartRicky,0,"2009, well, 2008. Friend's father worked for Bioware, and I got to play an early alpha at their place.",0
deaf_michael_scott,1,"You know you could just share your source for the (incorrect) information that proves there are clauses preventing older COD games and Spyro and Crash and Tony Hawk etc.  from joining Game Pass, instead of doing personal attacks, right?  If that were the case, I'd have stood corrected.",0
