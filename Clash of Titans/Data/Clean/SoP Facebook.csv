Angelique Pelser,HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CANT PLAY GOING ON 36HOURS NOW. CAUSE CONSOLE SHARING AND OFFLINE PLAY IS NOT WORKING ( FOR ONLY SOME PEOPLE) BUT PLAYSTATION CANT EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. NOT EVEN PLAYSTATION SUPPORT KNOWS WHATS GOING ON. NICE JOB PLAYSTATION! ,0,1,6/6/2024,02:23:20 AM

Ashton Nixon,"poor playstation has to ask microsoft for help with AI technology, but wants to make exclusive games. Lets talk playstation of how they steal food off me and other people when new games release. Especially when we owned or controlled the food or bought it.",1,0,6/6/2024,11:46:21 AM
Ashton Nixon,I don't understand people. A game similar to dark souls series or elden ring series releases in lords of fallen and the game only sells 1.2 million copies. Plus it has co op function. I don't know if you people just want to punish yourselves and say I don't deserve this game.,1,0,6/6/2024,11:58:04 AM
