Can you name 4 other actual exclusives that gamers have for PS5 only? This State of Play is a disaster. When main titles are another Remake of PS2 game and Astro Bot...

You can witness this simply by the typical slashers on show here and in all open world games. There are only a pathetic one or three NPC's using asset instances rendered to be animated on screen at one time hence the CPU and GPU compute power is seriously lacking. Games are released for the least hardware capable devices being consoles for compatibility reasons. For this reason consoles are slowing down more capable PC hardware gaming.
